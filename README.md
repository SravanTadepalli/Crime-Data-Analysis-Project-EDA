# Crime Data Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing crime data to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations in criminal activities across different areas. The analysis is performed using Python, leveraging data visualization techniques and statistical analysis to derive meaningful insights.

## 📊 Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Data Visualization & EDA Techniques

## 🔍 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of crime records with the following key columns:

Column Name
